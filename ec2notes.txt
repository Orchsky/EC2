1. How to connect Windows instance?
    1.1 SSH 22 for Linux instances 
    1.2 Windows requires RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) default port 3389

2. Create custom AMI (Amazon machine image) 
    2.1 Shift left --> Security as a priority 
    2.2 Organziation level companies use Hardened/Private AMI/Images 
    2.3 Hardened - encrypted (Encryption at Rest)
    2.4 What is AMI --> Preconfigured Software 
    2.5 Before building custom AMI from running instnace some security practices must be observed
        2.6. Sensitive data must be removed 
        2.7 cd .ssh and sudo shred authorized_keys and  rm -Rf authorized_keys 
        2.8 cd .aws and sudo shred credentials and rm -Rf credentials
        2.9 history , history -c --> current history, history -w --> entire history 
        2.10 Delete on termination is True --> Once instance volume gets deleted as well 

3. Scaling 
    3.1 Scalibility describes a system's elasticity. System's ability to grow, scale up, down or out. 
    3.2 2 types of Scaling
    3.3 Horizontal --> (aka scaling out) refers adding additional nodes or machines to your infrastructure
    to cope with new demands. If you are hosting an application on a server and find that it no longer has the 
    capacity or capabalities to handle traffic, adding additional EC2 maybe your solution
    3.4 Vertical --> (aka scaling up) describes adding additional resources to a system so that it meets demand. 

4. Advantages of Horizontal Scaling 
    4.1 Scaling is easier from hardware perspective --> Just add extra EC2s 
    4.2 Fewer periods of downtime 
    4.3 Increased resilience and fault tolerence 
    4.4 Increased performance 

5. Disadvantages of Horizontal scaling
    5.1 Increased complexity of maintenance and operation 
    5.2 Increased initial cost 


6. Advantages of Vertical scaling 
    6.1 Cost-effective 
    6.2 Less complex process communication 
    6.3 Less complicated maintenance
    6.4 less need for software changes 

7. Disadvantages of Vertical scaling
    7.1 Higher possibility of downtime --> EC2/VMs are immutable. For certain operations VM must be stopped 
    7.2 Single point of failure 
    7.3 Upgrade Limitations --> Each machine has its threshold for RAM, Storage and processing power. 

8. Interview. How do you collect the logs from Load Balancer? 
 Answer: LB Access Logs. Log destination is S3 bucket. After dumping all LB 
 access logs into S3 you can use Kibana, Splunk, Datadog, Grafana to analyze 
 and query the data. 
9. In case Access Logs is disabled what will be your solution? Python is a rescue.
