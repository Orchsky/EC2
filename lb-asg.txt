LB - ASG 

1. Why do we need a load balancer? LB are are used to increase capacity (concurrent users) and reliability 
of applications. LB lets you evenly distribute network traffic to prevent failure cause by overloading a 
particular resource. 
2. #!/bin/bash
    yum update -y
    yum install httpd -y
    cd /var/www/html
    touch index.html
    echo "Welcome to Orchsky" > /var/www/html/index.html
    service httpd start 
    chkconfig httpd on  --> chkconfig --> Run the app during the boot (restart) time 
3. epel --> extra packages enterprise linux 

Run stress test to validate that auto scaling working properly 
4. sudo amazon-linux-extras install epel -y 
5. sudo yum install -y stress
6. stress --cpu 2 --timeout 300

Network load balancer. 

1. Intended to handle millions of request per second or spike of traffic. 
2. Works great when there is unpredictable load 

Load test 

while true;
do 
wget <nlb dns name>
done
