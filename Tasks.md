## Task 1: New Tools Request For Ubuntu Instance
- Hello DevOps Team - I'm looking to install some tools onto an Ubuntu VM, what would be the best solution to install these?
    1. Docker
    2. Git
    3. Tree
    4. Terraform
    5. Kubernetes CLI
    6. AWS CLI

- Show a working demo of an EC2 Ubuntu instance with all of these tools installed with the best automated approach that you can think of.

## Task 2: Arcana Web Application Setup
- Create and configure a robust solution for Ubuntu virtual machines with automated capabilities for scaling and load distribution in us-east-1 region

- On these virtual machines we need to have NGINX webserver installed to host a web application

- This is where the web application code is located [Repo](https://github.com/zce/html5up)

- Figure out how to host the [Arcana](https://github.com/zce/html5up/tree/master/arcana) web application onto the virtual machines

- Demo your solution by showing your setup and live web app running on the virtual machines.

## Task 3: Create A Custom AMI
